# Quickstart

### Install

Nothing to do here, no gulp tasks, nothing to setup.. just open index.html in your browser!

### Structure

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: Contains all functions to build the resume.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the resume.

### Opportunities for improvement

If you like it and want to customize it, just fork this repo and feel free to whatever you want with it.

We could use a MV* framework and bind the UI to the JS resume builder functions and we could create an app where the user can make any customization he wants to his resume.
