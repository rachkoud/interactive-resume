# Resume Builder

This project is part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), it is [a resume builder](http://rachkoud.github.io/interactive-resume/index.html).

# Further enhancements
We could use a MV* framework and bind the UI to the JS resume builder functions. The idea is to allow the user to make customizations within the app.
